# Roguelike-tutorial
Practicing Python coding with the TCOD Roguelike dev tutorial on rogueliketutorials.com http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/part-0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I'm teaching myself game dev, Python 3, and github, so bear with me. Feel free to let me know if there are best practices I could use.
